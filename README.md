# Create and Handle Flutter Input Form like a Pro

Input forms are one of the ways software applications collect data from users. Thus, they're an indispensable component that makes up the user interfaces of any application. We see them in action in scenarios like; user signup & login, sending a message on an instant messaging app, checking out orders on an e-commerce app, and so on. That being said, it's important to make input forms readily accessible and easy to navigate by users.

The aim here is to create and handle a Flutter Form with TextFormField widgets for a better user experience.
