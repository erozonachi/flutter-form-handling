# Create and Handle Flutter Input Form like a Pro

```
Input forms are one of the ways software applications collect data from users. Thus, they're an indispensable component that makes up the user interfaces of any application. We see them in action in scenarios like; user signup & login, sending a message on an instant messaging app, checking out orders on an e-commerce app, and so on. That being said, it's important to make input forms readily accessible and easy to navigate by users.

The aim here is to create and handle a Flutter Form with TextFormField widgets for a better user experience.
```

```
A Flutter Form class is a widget that can be used to wrap/group form fields for easy save, reset, or validation of the grouped form fields. A TextFormField class, on the other hand, is a widget that wraps a TextField widget in a FormField widget.
